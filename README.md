# About-Me

21 | CSE Undergrad |

Hello, I'm Diya Istwal, a final-year B.Tech student specializing in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science at Graphic Era University, Dehradun, India.

I make dashboards that look like art, organize things for fun (seriously, color-coding is a personality trait). With a passion for AI, analytics and creativity, I enjoy building things that are both smart and simple.

Feel free to explore my work, connect with me, and let's collaborate on exciting opportunities in the world of data science and AI :)
